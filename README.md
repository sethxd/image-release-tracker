**Update: 12/13/18**
Image changed the structure of their upcoming releases content, and the API is currently broken. If I have time I'll dig into it and see if I can rebuild it, but I don't know if that will happen or not. It was fun while it lasted!

# Image Comics Release Tracker

I made this because I wanted to be able to see, at a glance, which new Image trades were coming out every week. It only works a month or two out from the present, past or future, depending on what Image has filled out on their site. Try it out here: [http://www.seth-dehaan.com/image-release-tracker/](http://www.seth-dehaan.com/image-release-tracker/).
